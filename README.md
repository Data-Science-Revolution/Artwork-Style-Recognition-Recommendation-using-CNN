# Artwork-Style-Recognition-Recommendation-using-CNN
I am developing a machine learning system that can recognize the style or genre of visual artworks and recommend similar pieces and artists to other users. This project can encompass various forms of visual art, including paintings, sculptures, photography, and more.
The subjectivity of art, its interdisciplinary nature, historical significance, and intellectual property considerations make my project unique and authentic.
